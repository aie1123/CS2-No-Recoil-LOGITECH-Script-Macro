# Considering that some people have reported VAC bans(I only recommend using this macro when playing on the CS2 official server, Do not use this macro on other third-party platform servers.), it is recommended to use a new method to read macros:  
* ① Download and place the macro file in a location other than the C drive  
* ② Create a new script in GHUB  
* ③ Edit the script code to:  
Example:` data = dofile[[D:\yourmacrolocation.lua]]`  
# Q&A
  ## Q:How does this work?  
  ## A: 
  * ① First you need a programmable Logitech mouse  
  * ② Make sure GHUB is running as an administrator  
  * ③ Download this script and import into GHUB
  * ④ Bind the weapon to be used to the side button (modify it in the script)  
  * ⑤ Enter the game and enjoy(When this macro is working, the Scroll lock light (if your keyboard has one) will light up, and it will go out when the macro turned off.)

## Q: What is the difference between rebound and norebound?  
## A:  
The rebound version will automatically rebound to the initial position after the macro finished or release of the left mouse button, while the norebound version will not.  
## Q: Explain what "one click", "Double-click" and "Ctrl + mouse side button" mean.  
## A:  
"One-click" means clicking the corresponding mouse side button once to enable the corresponding firearm, "Double-click" means double-clicking the corresponding mouse side button to enable the corresponding firearm, and "Ctrl + mouse side button" means pressing the "Ctrl" key on the keyboard and clicking the corresponding mouse side button once to enable the corresponding firearm.
## Q: How do I switch macros between different weapons?
## A:  
For example: I am using an AK-47 and I have pressed the macro to enable the corresponding weapon. When I drop it and pick up an M4A4, I need to press the corresponding key to enable the M4A4's corresponding macro (if you are not sure whether the macro is enabled, you can press the off key and then press the corresponding key to enable the M4A4 macro)
